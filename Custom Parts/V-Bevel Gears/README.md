#Space Jockey V-Bevel Gears
==================
These gears were designed to be 3D-printed, and mesh together well.
They use configuration tables, so you can specifiy your desired pitch diameter and they will auto-update.
VGearServo has a Hitec servo-spline designed in, so it can be screwed right into a Hobby Servo.

These are 16 pitch, 1/4" thick, with a 60 degree pitch angle
I recommend printing them with 3 shells, and at least 25% infill (Makerbot ABS)
