#MRSD-Parts-Library
==================

A collection of robot-friendly Solidworks parts
Most parts are sorted by manufacturer and named by part numbers (Where possible)
Custom in-house parts (3D printed components and useful widgets) are in the Custom Parts folder.

**CAVEAT EMPTOR!** While these parts have been useful to teams in the past, they are not guaranteed to be exactly dimensionally accurate. _Always_ verify critical dimensions before using.
